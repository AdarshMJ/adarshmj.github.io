My research interests broadly encompass graph representation learning and geometric deep learning. 
I am currently focusing on studying generalization behavior in Graph Neural Networks. This includes memorization vs generalization, exploring phenomena like double-descent and Grokking in GNNs.

Below you will find a list of all of my publications.
