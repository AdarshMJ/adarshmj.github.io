My research interests broadly encompass graph representation learning and geometric deep learning. Currently I am working on understanding and improving the generalization behavior of Graph Neural Networks. This includes studying phenomena like over-squashing, over-smoothing and understanding if, when and why GNNs memorize vs generalize. Below you will find a list of my publications, in the past I have worked on computer vision problems such as under-water image enhancement and anomaly detection in videos.
