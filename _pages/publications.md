My research focuses on graph representation learning and geometric deep learning. My PhD will explore Graph Diffusion Models. Specifically, I am studying how symmetry constraints and equivariant architectures influence their learning dynamics and inductive biases.

During my masters I investigated the generalization behavior of graph neural networks, proposing approaches to mitigate structural limitations such as over-squashing and over-smoothing. I also introduced the first-ever framework demonstrating that GNNs can memorize node labels. I also have experience working on deep learning for computer vision problems.
