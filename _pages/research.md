### Talks
* June 6, 2025 - Gave a talk titled [Learning on Graphs: Strategies for Improving and Understanding Generalization in Graph Neural Networks](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kletech-center-of-excellence-in-visual-intelligence-cevi_neurips-iclr-visionplusplus-activity-7335637116611084289-h3jn?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAABve1eYB68zJjn33G6q9hhiYBqweTP9YvPM) at my alma mater - [CEVI](https://cevi.co.in), KLE Technological University, Hubli, India.


* Jan 28, 2025 - Had a funtime talking about our recently accepted NeurIPS paper with neptune.ai. The goal was to explain our research using simpler analogies intended for broader audience. The video of the talk is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5yfyldy_Vw).


* From June 12-14, 2024, I was at [Helmholtz AI Conference](https://haicon24.de) at DÃ¼sseldorf, where I presented our recent work on [How to mitigate both over-squashing and over-smoothing in GNNs?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04612v1).
