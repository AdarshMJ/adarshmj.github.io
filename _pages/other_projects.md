* I sometimes do a reading challenge on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/145296740-adarsh). If you want to chat about books, [poetry](https://adarshmj.substack.com) and ML research feel free to reach out!

* From 2019-2020, I worked as a research assistant on the [Underwater 3D Reconstruction](https://cevi.co.in/projects/sponsored/dst-dp) project.
  
* In 2019, I had a paper accepted at one of the NeurIPS workshops on [Graph Representation Learning](https://grlearning.github.io/papers/). But getting a visa for Canada was a nightmare. Here is my [interview](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/13/tech/ai-conference-african-academics/index.html) with [Hannah Ziady](https://x.com/hannaziady?s=20) on bias and how researchers from third world countries are denied visa for attending the most prestigious conference

* I also dabbled in a startup gig called Silicon14 (Tweak Labs) Inc. which I co-founded (I was the CTO :P) while I was in my second year of undergraduate studies. It dealt with developing novel [hardware augmentations](https://xlr8community.github.io/) for enabling rapid prototyping of embedded systems/IoT projects. We designed a new line of micro-controller development boards that won the "Best Practical US-Based Project" in a contest organized by [Hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/adarshmj/accexlron-a-rapid-prototyping-board-5d86c3).
I was featured in local newspaper highlighting my entrepreneurial journey - [Deccan Herald](https://www.deccanherald.com/content/649025/city-youth-bring-tech-solutions.html) .

* I was once disillusioned enough to think I could start a video analytics company after developing a cool video summarization algorithm during my Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU). I named it [Synoptycs](https://synoptycs.github.io/index.html#header2-f) and even toyed with the idea of calling it bonsAI (a nod to its purpose as a video summarization engine, of course). I pitched the concept to a few investors but ultimately realized the technology was already well-established, and the market was too crowded to break into. Now, it lives on as an obscure demo video, lost in the vast abyss of Internet debris.
