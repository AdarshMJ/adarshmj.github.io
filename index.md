My name is Adarsh Jamadandi. I have a Master's degree in Computer Science from Saarland University. My research interests include Graph Representation Learning and Geometric Deep Learning. 

I am currently working as a research assistant at the [SprintML Lab](https://sprintml.com/team/), studying the generalization behavior of graph neural networks under the supervision of Franziska Boenisch and Adam Dziedzic.

I finished my master's thesis at the [Relational Machine Learning Lab](https://relationalml.github.io) under the supervision of Dr. Rebekka Burkholz.

Previously, I completed my Bachelors in Electronics and Communication Engineering with [Dr. Uma Mudenagudi](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=xBaqwmkAAAAJ&hl=en) as my advisor.
