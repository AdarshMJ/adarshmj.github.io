Hi ðŸ‘‹  

I'm Adarsh Jamadandi. I'm a PhD student at IRISA, Rennes, working on Graph Representation Learning and Geometric Deep Learning under the supervision of [Dr. Nicolas Keriven](https://nkeriven.github.io) and co-supervised by 
[Dr. Aline Roumy](https://people.rennes.inria.fr/Aline.Roumy/).

I completed my Master's in Computer Science at Saarland University, Germany, where I wrote my thesis at the Relational Machine Learning Lab with [Dr. Rebekka Burkholz](https://relationalml.github.io). 

Before starting my PhD, I worked as a research assistant at the [SprintML Lab](https://sprintml.com/team/) with Franziska Boenisch and Adam Dziedzic. 

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from India. 
My thesis was on anomaly detection in videos with [Dr. Uma Mudenagudi](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=xBaqwmkAAAAJ&hl=en) as my advisor.
