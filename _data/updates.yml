  content: "Now pre-print alert! Finding Memo(rization) in Graph Neural Networks. Do GNNs also memorize training data? How do we explain the emergence of memorization in GNNs? Why do only certain nodes get memorized? We introduce the first framework for studying label memorization in GNNs, showing that GNNs' implicit bias toward leveraging graph structure in low-homophiliic settings results in a model that memorizes. We also explain why only certain nodes are prone to memorization via a novel label disagreement score.

Why does graph rewiring via spectral gap maximization work? Should we always maximize the spectral gap? What dictates the success of these methods? Would additional information such as node features and latent community structure help better rewire the graph? These are some of the questions we investigate in this work.

We introduce the Braess Paradox for the first time in context of GNNs. We propose a novel graph pruning strategy that can mitigate both over-squashing and over-smoothing and bonus also find graph lottery tickets!
