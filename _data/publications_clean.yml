  abstract: "Graph rewiring methods have emerged as a powerful technique to address over-squashing and over-smoothing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, the underlying mechanisms that drive their effectiveness remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate why spectral gap maximization works as a rewiring objective and under what conditions it may fail."

  abstract: "We introduce the Braess Paradox in the context of Graph Neural Networks for the first time, showing that adding edges to a graph can actually hurt performance. Building on this insight, we propose a novel spectral graph pruning strategy that simultaneously addresses over-squashing and over-smoothing."

Our experiments report strong consistent improvements in Mean Rank and Mean Average Precision (MAP) values compared to probabilistic word embedding frameworks."
