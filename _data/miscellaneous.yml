  abstract: "Contemplated starting a video analytics company after developing a video summarization algorithm during my Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU). Named it Synoptycs (also considered bonsAI). Pitched to investors but realized the technology was already well-established and the market was too crowded. Now exists as an obscure demo video in the vast abyss of Internet debris."
